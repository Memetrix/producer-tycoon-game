- [x] Avatar regeneration option
- [x] Confirmation screen
- [x] Starting resources applied correctly (verified in app/page.tsx:251-277)

---

### 7.2 Main Navigation
**Status:** 🐛 HAS ISSUES

**Implementation:** components/bottom-nav.tsx (44 lines) + app/page.tsx (routing)

#### ✅ DONE:
- [x] Bottom nav bar with 5 tabs (bottom-nav.tsx:12-18)
- [x] Screen transitions with fade animation (app/page.tsx:285-290)
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Active tab highlighting
- [x] Tab icons (Home, Music, Zap, Users, BookOpen)

#### 🐛 NAVIGATION ISSUES FOUND:

**1. Missing Screens:**
- ❌ **"Profile" tab** - references in bottom-nav but NO ProfileScreen component exists!
- ❌ **"Tasks" tab** - labeled as "Обучение" but uses `upgrades` screen (confusing!)
- ❌ **"Contracts" tab** - system fully designed but no UI access
- ❌ **"Story" tab** - no narrative UI
- ❌ **"Shop" tab** - no monetization UI
- ❌ **"Leaderboards" tab** - no competitive UI

**2. Naming Confusion:**
Bottom nav shows "Обучение" (Training) but actually shows `upgrades-screen.tsx` which contains:
- Daily Tasks ✅
- Free Training ✅
- Label Deals ✅
- Streak Rewards ✅

This is **MISLEADING** - tab should be "Задания" (Tasks) not "Обучение"!

**3. Screen Type Definition:**
\`\`\`typescript
// app/page.tsx:27
export type Screen = "home" | "stage" | "studio" | "artists" | "upgrades" | "skills" | "contracts" | "shop" | "leaderboards" | "story"
\`\`\`
Only 6 screens defined, but need:
- "contracts" (Beat Contracts UI)
- "shop" (Telegram Stars monetization)
- "leaderboards" (Competitive rankings)
- "story" (Narrative system)

**4. Skills Screen Access:**
Skills screen exists (skills-screen.tsx) but NOT in bottom nav! Only accessible from upgrades screen → "Древо навыков" card.

#### ❌ NOT STARTED:
- [ ] **Shop tab/screen** (CRITICAL - monetization!)
- [ ] **Leaderboards tab/screen** (CRITICAL - retention!)
- [ ] **Contracts tab/screen** (logic ready, just needs UI!)
- [ ] **Story/Narrative tab/screen** (CRITICAL - differentiator!)

## PRIORITY MATRIX

### 🔴 CRITICAL (LAUNCH BLOCKERS)
1. **Telegram Stars integration** - Need monetization!
2. **Leaderboards** - Whales need competitive goals
3. **Tutorial/Onboarding** - Players will be lost without it
4. **Beat Contracts UI** - System exists but invisible
5. **Story/Narrative system** - Core differentiator missing
6. **Sound effects for rhythm game** - Silent rhythm game is weird
7. **Touch button alignment fix** - Mobile UX critical

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Pre-Launch)
8. Shop system (energy refills, speed-ups)
9. Artist portraits generation (8 cel shading portraits)
10. Gacha lootboxes (major revenue source)
11. Battle Pass (recurring revenue)
12. More music tracks (100+ needed)
13. Telegram Mini App integration

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-Launch)
14. TON Wallet + $BEAT token
15. NFT system
16. Referral system
17. Social features
18. More animations & polish

### ⚪ LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
19. Auto-play mode
20. Practice mode
21. Advanced analytics
22. Community features

## NEXT STEPS

**Let's audit step-by-step:**
1. I'll check each feature one-by-one in codebase
2. Update this doc with findings (✅ working, 🐛 buggy, ❌ missing)
3. Create detailed implementation plan for critical features
4. Start implementation in priority order

**Ready to start audit?** Which area should we audit first?
- [ ] Core Game Loop (rhythm game, energy, resources)
- [ ] Progression Systems (equipment, artists, skills)
- [ ] UI/UX (all screens, navigation, animations)
- [ ] Backend (Supabase, data persistence, offline earnings)
