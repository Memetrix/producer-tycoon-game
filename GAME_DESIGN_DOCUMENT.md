## Economy System V3

### Reputation Tier System
Reputation determines your tier, which affects stage, unlocks, and price multipliers:

| Tier | Reputation Range | Stage Name | Price Multiplier | Unlocks |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | 0 - 500 | –£–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –±–∏—Ç–º–µ–π–∫–µ—Ä | 1.0x | All Tier 1 artists, Tier 1 skills |
| **Tier 2** | 500 - 2,000 | –ú–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥—é—Å–µ—Ä | 1.25x | Tier 2 artists, Tier 2 skills, Easy contracts |
| **Tier 3** | 2,000 - 5,000 | –†–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä | 1.5x | Tier 3 artists, Tier 3 skills, Medium contracts, Indie Label |
| **Tier 4** | 5,000 - 15,000 | –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ | 1.75x | All contracts, Small Label |
| **Tier 5** | 15,000 - 50,000 | –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å | 2.0x | Major Label |
| **Tier 6** | 50,000+ | –õ–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥—é—Å–µ—Ä | 2.5x | - |

- Touch and keyboard controls

**Hit Detection:**
- **Perfect Hit**: ¬±12px from hit line ‚Üí 100 points
- **Good Hit**: ¬±25px from hit line ‚Üí 50 points
- **Offbeat**: ¬±50px ‚Üí 25 points
- **Miss**: >50px or no tap ‚Üí 0 points, combo breaks

**Track & Difficulty Selection:**
- Player chooses track from library (29+ uploaded tracks)
- Player chooses difficulty (1-5):
  - –õ—ë–≥–∫–∞—è (1): 1.0x price, +5 quality bonus
  - –ù–æ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è (2): 1.3x price, +10 quality bonus
  - –°–ª–æ–∂–Ω–∞—è (3): 1.6x price, +15 quality bonus

  - –ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä (5): 2.2x price, +25 quality bonus

**Beat Quality Calculation (UPDATED):**
```javascript
// Base quality from rhythm
baseQuality = 20
rhythmBonus = Math.floor(accuracy * 0.6) // Up to 60 points

// Difficulty bonus
difficultyBonus = difficulty * 3 // Up to 15 points

// Equipment bonus (reduced from v2)
equipmentBonus = Math.floor(
  (phone * 2 + headphones * 2 + mic * 3 + computer * 5 +
   midi * 2 + audioInterface * 4) * 0.3
)

// Skill bonus (Phase 3)
skillBonus = getSkillQualityBonus(skills) // +5/+10/+20%

finalQuality = Math.min(100, baseQuality + rhythmBonus + difficultyBonus +
                              equipmentBonus + skillBonus)
```

**Beat Price Calculation (UPDATED):**
```javascript
basePrice = 30
qualityBonus = Math.floor((quality - 60) * 1.5)
difficultyMultiplier = 1 + (difficulty - 1) * 0.3
reputationBonus = Math.floor(reputation * 0.05)

// Phase 1: Tier price multiplier
tierMultiplier = getTierPriceMultiplier(reputation) // 1.0x - 2.5x

// Phase 3: Skill price multiplier
skillMultiplier = getSkillPriceMultiplier(skills) // +10/+25/+50%

finalPrice = Math.floor(
  (basePrice + qualityBonus + reputationBonus) *
  difficultyMultiplier * tierMultiplier * skillMultiplier
)
```

**Energy System (UPDATED in Phase 1):**

- Example: MC Flow = [0, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 25, 31, 38, 47, 58]%

**Total Passive Income (All Max):**
- Street Poet Lvl 10: 85/min
- MC Flow Lvl 10: 108/min
- Lil Dreamer Lvl 10: 136/min
- Young Legend Lvl 10: 222/min
- Local Hero Lvl 10: 298/min
- Scene Leader Lvl 10: 376/min
- City Star Lvl 10: 698/min
- State Champion Lvl 10: 834/min
- **Total: ~2,757/min = $165,420/hour = $661,680 for 4 hours**

**UI Display:**
- Shows current income per hour ($/hour)
- Shows energy bonus percentage
- Shows next level stats in preview
- Artist portraits (placeholders currently)

### 5. Reputation & Stage System

**Stage Auto-Calculation (Phase 1 Fix):**
```javascript
currentStage = Math.min(6, getReputationTier(reputation))
```
- Stage is now **calculated** from reputation tier, not stored separately
- Removes "stageProgress" system (deprecated)
- Stage always matches tier (1-6)

**Reputation Sources:**
- Beat creation: ~5-10 rep per beat (based on quality)
- Daily tasks: 150-225 rep per day
- Streak rewards: 100-15,000 rep (7-60 day milestones)
- Free training: 250 rep (one-time)
- Beat contracts: 200-1,500 rep per contract

**Reputation Sinks:**
- None (reputation is pure progression resource)
- Gates content at 500, 2k, 5k, 15k, 50k rep

**Stage Titles:**
- Tier 1: –£–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –±–∏—Ç–º–µ–π–∫–µ—Ä
- Tier 2: –ú–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥—é—Å–µ—Ä
- Tier 3: –†–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä
- Tier 4: –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞
- Tier 5: –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å
- Tier 6: –õ–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥—é—Å–µ—Ä

### 6. Daily Tasks System (Phase 2)

**Implementation Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Task Reset:**
- Resets at midnight local time
- Checks on app load if new day
- Breaks streak if >1 day passed

**Task Types:**
- Alternates between Subscribe (odd days) and Like (even days)
- 3 tasks per day
- Must complete all 3 to increment streak

**Streak Storage:**
- `daily_tasks_completed`: Array of completed task IDs
- `daily_tasks_last_reset`: ISO timestamp of last completion
- `daily_streak`: Current streak count
- `claimed_streak_rewards`: Array of claimed milestone numbers

**Auto-Claim Rewards:**
- Checks for unclaimed milestones on streak update
- Automatically claims and shows alert
- Adds money + reputation to player
- Marks milestone as claimed

**UI Features:**
- Progress bar showing tasks completed
- Countdown timer to next reset
- Streak flame icon with day count
- Streak milestone progress card
- List of all streak rewards with claimed status

---

### 7. Offline Earnings System

**Calculation:**
```javascript
minutesAway = Math.min(actualMinutesAway, 240) // Cap at 4 hours
artistIncome = getTotalPassiveIncome(artists) // Sum of all artist income
labelIncome = getLabelDealsPassiveIncome(labelDeals) // Sum of label income
totalPassiveIncome = artistIncome + labelIncome
offlineEarnings = minutesAway * totalPassiveIncome
```

**Modal Display:**
- Shows time away (formatted as Xh Ym)
- Shows total earnings
- Confetti animation for big earnings
- Auto-adds to player money

**Balance Notes:**
- 4-hour cap prevents extreme idle advantages
- Encourages 3-4 check-ins per day
- Rewards artist/label investment
- Offline earnings can exceed active earnings at high levels

---

## Balance Analysis

### Current State (Post Phase 1-3 Rebalancing)

#### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Energy System**
**Problem (V2):** Energy regeneration too slow, only 5 beats per session

**Solution (V3):**
- Doubled regen rate (1 ‚Üí 2/min)
- Increased base max (100 ‚Üí 150)
- Reduced cost per beat (20 ‚Üí 15)
- Result: **10 beats per session, 75min recharge**

**Impact:** Active play much more rewarding, less waiting

---

#### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Equipment Usefulness**
**Problem (V2):** MIDI and Audio Interface existed but didn't affect quality

**Solution (V3):**
- Added MIDI (+2 quality/level) to calculation
- Added Audio Interface (+4 quality/level) to calculation
- All 6 equipment categories now functional

**Impact:** Players no longer waste money on useless upgrades

---

#### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Stage Progression**
**Problem (V2):** Stage and stageProgress disconnected from gameplay

**Solution (V3):**
- Stage now auto-calculated from reputation tier
- Removed stageProgress (deprecated)
- Stage always matches player's actual progression

**Impact:** Stage now meaningful indicator of progress

---

#### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Reputation Underutilized**
**Problem (V2):** Reputation only gated Young Legend (500 rep), no other use

**Solution (V3):**
- 6 reputation tiers with clear breakpoints
- Tiers gate artists, skills, contracts, labels
- Tiers provide price multipliers (1.0x ‚Üí 2.5x)
- Major milestones at 500, 2k, 5k, 15k, 50k rep

**Impact:** Reputation now central progression mechanic

---

#### ‚úÖ **IMPROVED: Active vs Passive Income Balance**
**Problem (V2):** Late-game passive income >> active income

**Solution (V3):**
- Reduced equipment multiplier (0.5x ‚Üí 0.3x)
- Increased active income via:
  - Difficulty multipliers (1.0x ‚Üí 2.2x)
  - Tier multipliers (1.0x ‚Üí 2.5x)
  - Skill multipliers (up to +85% with Mogul)
- Result: **Active income can reach $1,000+ per beat at high tier**

**Comparison (Tier 5, Max Equipment + Skills, Master difficulty, 95% accuracy):**
- Active: ~$1,200 per beat * 10 beats = $12,000 per session (75min)
- Active hourly: ~$9,600/hour
- Passive (max): ~$165,000/hour (all artists + labels)
- **Passive still higher, but active is 16x better than V2**

**Balance Notes:**
- Passive still dominates at max levels (intentional for idle mechanics)
- Active is competitive and more rewarding in mid-game
- Skill bonuses make active play scale better into late game

---

#### ‚úÖ **NEW: Skills Tree (Phase 3)**
**Addition:** 9 skills providing permanent bonuses across 3 branches

**Impact:**
- Adds long-term money sink ($90k total)
- Provides meaningful power increases
- Creates strategic choices (which branch to prioritize)
- Mogul skill (+50% price) is game-changing for active players

**Balance:**
- Skills are expensive but permanent
- Money branch has best ROI for active players
- Energy branch reduces bottleneck
- Quality branch provides raw power

---

#### ‚úÖ **NEW: Label Deals (Phase 3)**
**Addition:** 3 investment-based passive income sources

**Impact:**
- Adds major money sink ($125k total)
- Provides permanent passive income boost
- Creates progression goals (save for next label)
- Rewards long-term play

**Balance:**
- 100-hour ROI for each label (fair for idle mechanic)
- Combined with artists for massive passive earnings
- Reputation gates prevent early abuse

---

#### ‚úÖ **NEW: Beat Contracts (Phase 3)**
**Addition:** Challenge-based system with targeted requirements

**Impact (Future - not yet in UI):**
- Adds structured challenges
- Rewards skill-based play
- Provides alternative reputation source
- Creates variety in objectives

**Balance:**
- Rewards scale with difficulty (2x-7x normal earnings)
- Hard contracts require near-perfect play
- Time-limited contracts add urgency

---

### Remaining Issues

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inflation at High Tiers**
**Problem:** Tier 6 players with max skills can earn $1,000+ per beat

**Impact:**
- Money loses meaning at extreme late game
- All upgrades trivially affordable
- No challenge remaining

**Potential Solutions:**
- Add prestige/rebirth system
- Add cosmetic money sinks (studio customization)
- Add competitive elements (leaderboards, tournaments)
- Cap tier multiplier at Tier 5 (2.0x max)

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beat Contracts Not in UI**
**Problem:** System fully implemented in code but no UI to access

**Impact:**
- Players can't access Phase 3 content
- No contract refresh mechanics
- Missing gameplay variety

**Solution:** Add Contracts screen with:
- Available contracts list
- Active contracts tracker
- Completed contracts history
- Daily refresh system

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Artist Portraits Placeholders**
**Problem:** Most artists use placeholder images

**Impact:**
- Less visual appeal
- Harder to distinguish artists
- Professional feel reduced

**Solution:**
- Generate AI portraits for all 8 artists
- Use art-generator system already in place
- Match artist descriptions (genre, tier, vibe)
