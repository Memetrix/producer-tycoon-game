-- Fix RLS Policies for Security
-- This migration replaces permissive policies with proper auth-based policies
-- Date: 2025-10-21

-- ============================================================================

GRANT SELECT ON public.leaderboards TO anon, authenticated;

-- ============================================================================
-- SECURITY NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- ‚úÖ Security Improvements:
-- 1. Users can only read/write their OWN data (based on auth.uid())
-- 2. Beats table allows public SELECT for leaderboards (read-only)
-- 3. Created leaderboards view for public access
-- 4. Removed permissive policies (using (true))
--
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
-- - auth.uid() returns the authenticated user's UUID from Supabase Auth
-- - This requires Supabase Auth to be properly configured
-- - Anonymous users (not logged in) will have auth.uid() = NULL and won't match any rows
--
-- üìù To apply this migration:
-- Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor or via migration tool
