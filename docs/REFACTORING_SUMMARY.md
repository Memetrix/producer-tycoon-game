# Stage Screen Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored `stage-screen.tsx` from 829 lines into 6 smaller, more maintainable files with performance optimizations.

## Files Created

### Components (5 new files)

1. **`components/stage/track-selector.tsx`** (85 lines)
   - Handles track selection UI
   - Shows available tracks from database
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Optimized with `React.memo`

2. **`components/stage/difficulty-selector.tsx`** (131 lines)
   - Difficulty selection screen
   - Dynamic difficulty count based on OSZ file
   - Visual difficulty indicators
   - Optimized with `React.memo`

3. **`components/stage/beat-creation-card.tsx`** (136 lines)
   - Main beat creation interface
   - Shows beat cover and status
   - Sell beat and create NFT buttons
   - Optimized with `React.memo`

4. **`components/stage/beat-stats-cards.tsx`** (29 lines)
   - Display stats (beats created, earnings, reputation)
   - Simple 3-column grid layout
   - Optimized with `React.memo`

5. **`components/stage/beat-history.tsx`** (69 lines)
   - List of created beats
   - Date formatting utility
   - Scrollable history
   - Optimized with `React.memo` and `useMemo`

### Utilities (1 new file)

6. **`lib/beat-calculations.ts`** (70 lines)
   - `calculateBeatQuality()` - Quality calculation formula
   - `calculateBeatPrice()` - Price calculation formula
   - Extracted for testability and reusability
   - Pure functions (easy to unit test)

### Main File (refactored)

**`components/stage-screen.tsx`** (500 lines, reduced from 829)
- Orchestration and state management
- Rhythm game integration
- AI generation logic (name, cover)
- Now 40% smaller and more focused

## Performance Optimizations

### React.memo
All 5 sub-components wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

### useMemo
Memoized expensive calculations:
- `ENERGY_COST` - Recalculates only when skills change
- `currentStage` - Recalculates only when reputation changes
- `currentStageTitle` - Recalculates only when stage changes

### useCallback
Memoized callback functions to prevent child re-renders:
- `handleSellBeat` - Stable reference unless dependencies change
- `handleResultsContinue` - Stable across renders
- `startCreating` - Stable unless energy/cost changes
- `handleTrackSelect` - Stable unless equipment changes
- `handleStartGame` - Stable across renders
- `handleRhythmComplete` - Stable across renders

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- **Smaller files**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Easier to navigate**: 69-136 lines per component vs 829 lines
- **Clear separation**: UI components vs logic vs calculations

### Performance
- **Reduced re-renders**: React.memo prevents unnecessary component updates
- **Optimized calculations**: useMemo caches expensive operations
- **Stable callbacks**: useCallback prevents child re-renders

### Testability
- **Pure functions**: `beat-calculations.ts` can be unit tested easily
- **Isolated components**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Mocked dependencies**: Easy to mock props and test behavior

### Reusability
- **Shared calculations**: `beat-calculations.ts` can be used elsewhere
- **Standalone components**: Sub-components can be reused in other screens
- **Consistent UI**: Beat history/stats patterns can be copied

## File Size Comparison

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Before** |
| `stage-screen.tsx` | 829 | Everything |
| **After** |
| `stage-screen.tsx` | 500 | Orchestration |
| `track-selector.tsx` | 85 | Track selection |
| `difficulty-selector.tsx` | 131 | Difficulty selection |
| `beat-creation-card.tsx` | 136 | Beat creation UI |
| `beat-stats-cards.tsx` | 29 | Stats display |
| `beat-history.tsx` | 69 | Beat history |
| `beat-calculations.ts` | 70 | Calculation formulas |
| **Total** | 1020 | **40% reduction in main file** |

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Generating static pages (18/18)
# No errors, no TypeScript issues
```

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for `beat-calculations.ts`
2. Add integration tests for sub-components
3. Consider extracting more components if needed (e.g., rhythm game wrapper)
4. Monitor performance in production with React DevTools Profiler
